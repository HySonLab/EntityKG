# EntityKG

This repository contains the codebase for the **wav2graph** paper. 

## Project Overview

The **wav2graph** paper presents a novel approach to constructing entity knowledge graphs from speech data. This repository provides the necessary scripts, configurations, and setup instructions to reproduce the experiments discussed in the paper.

## Setup

To set up the environment and run the experiments, follow the steps below:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Before you start, create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

\```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

### 2. Configure Hugging Face Token

You will need a Hugging Face API token to access certain resources used in this project. Insert your Hugging Face token into the relevant YAML configuration files.

### 3. Run the Experiments

Once the environment is set up and the configurations are complete, you can run the experiments using the provided script.

\```bash
sh run.sh
\```
